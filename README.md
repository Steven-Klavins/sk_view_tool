# SkViewTool

## About

This gem provides various HTML generators, however, the purpose of its creation was to explore how gems are built and distributed.Â 
I may update it at some point in the near future, however, as it presently stands SkViewTool is still very minimal. This said, for now, I would recommend sticking to Rails default helper methods or seeking out another gem more fit for your needs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sk_view_tool', git: "https://github.com/Steven-Klavins/sk_view_tool"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sk_view_tool
